# Music Library Project
It's a pure php based website using bootstrap 4.

## Project Setup
First copy all the files and folder into `htdocs` and the open `localhost/phpmyadmin` on your favorite browser. After that you need to create a database with `utf8mb4_general_ci`. Then click the database name from the left panel and select import from top top right to import `sevenmusic.sql` from the root project directory...

After all of these steps your are good to go and create your first music post.

**If you changed the user name or password of phpmyadmin from default you need to change username and password from `includes/db.php` file**
