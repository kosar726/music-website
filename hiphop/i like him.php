          [Intro: Denzel Curry]
          <br />
          Got the beat by Powers and we just made a banger
          <br />
          <br />
          [Chorus]
          <br />
          I like him, like him too
          <br />
          He my man, he my boo
          <br />
          He my type, he so cute
          <br />
          I want him, and I want him too
          <br />
          I like him, like him too
          <br />
          He my man, he my boo
          <br />
          He my type, he so cute
          <br />
          I want him, and I want him too
          <br />
          <br />
          [Verse 1]
          <br />
          Hop in the whip, hop in the truck
          <br />
          I do whatever the fuck that I want
          <br />
          I'm not a ho, I'm not a slut
          <br />
          I like to fuck and I sure like to suck
          <br />
          I am that bold, freezy like ice
          <br />
          I'm not a wife, so talk to me nice
          <br />
          You ain't my type, I don't like you
          <br />
          You a broke boy, look at your shoes
          <br />
          I am the player and I am the pimp
          <br />
          All of them boys, make 'em the trick
          <br />
          All of them boys, they on my shit
          <br />
          But all of them boys, they make me sick
          <br />
          <br />
          [Refrain]
          <br />
          I do not see you taming me
          <br />
          'Less them, they're entertaining me
          <br />
          They just tryna p-play with me
          <br />
          Play with me, you gon' pay the fee
          <br />
          <br />
          [Chorus]
          <br />
          I like him, like him too
          <br />
          He my man, he my boo
          <br />
          He my type, he so cute
          <br />
          I want him, and I want him too
          <br />
          I like him, like him too
          <br />
          He my man, he my boo
          <br />
          He my type, he so cute
          <br />
          I want him, and I want him too
          <br />
          <br />
          [Verse 2]
          <br />
          Dibble in this, and dibble in that
          <br />
          Get on his head like I am a brat
          <br />
          Play with his balls when he up to bat
          <br />
          Make daddy real proud like I'm Kyla Pratt
          <br />
          I'm taking a shower, he makin' the bed
          <br />
          When I leave the city, I leave him on read
          <br />
          Go get the next, like I get the bread
          <br />
          He coming with questions, I call him the feds
          <br />
          He let me plead the fifth
          <br />
          'Cause he know this box a gift
          <br />
          Eating breakfast, not at Tiff'
          <br />
          When I curve him he get stiff
          <br />
          I go beast mode
          <br />
          Ball like free throw
          <br />
          Game like cheat code
          <br />
          Pounds like kilo
          <br />
          <br />
          [Chorus]
          <br />
          I like him, like him too
          <br />
          He my man, he my boo
          <br />
          He my type, he so cute
          <br />
          I want him, and I want him too
          <br />
          I like him, like him too
          <br />
          He my man, he my boo
          <br />
          He my type, he so cute
          <br />
          I want him, and I want him too
          <br />
          <br />
          [Refrain]
