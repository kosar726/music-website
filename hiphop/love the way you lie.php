          [Chorus: Rihanna]
          <br />
          Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
          <br />
          Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts
          <br />
          Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
          <br />
          Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie
          <br />
          I love the way you lie
          <br />

          [Verse 1: Eminem]
          <br />
          I can't tell you what it really is, I can only tell you what it feels like
          <br />
          And right now, there's a steel knife in my windpipe
          <br />
          I can't breathe, but I still fight while I can fight
          <br />
          As long as the wrong feels right, it's like I'm in flight
          <br />
          High off her love, drunk from her hate
          <br />
          It's like I'm huffin' paint and I love her, the more I suffer, I suffocate
          <br />
          And right before I'm about to drown, she resuscitates
          <br />
          Me, she fuckin' hates me, and I love it — "Wait!
          <br />
          Where you going?" — "I'm leaving you!" — "No, you ain't!
          <br />
          Come back!" — We're runnin' right back, here we go again
          <br />
          It's so insane, 'cause when it's goin' good, it's goin' great
          <br />
          I'm Superman with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane
          <br />
          But when it's bad, it's awful, I feel so ashamed
          <br />
          I snapped, "Who's that dude?", I don't even know his name
          <br />
          I laid hands on her, I'll never stoop so low again
          <br />
          I guess I don't know my own strength
          <br />
          <br />
          [Chorus: Rihanna]
          <br />
          Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
          <br />
          Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts
          <br />
          Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
          <br />
          Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie
          <br />
          I love the way you lie
          <br />
          I love the way you lie
          <br />
          <br />
          [Verse 2: Eminem]
          <br />
          You ever love somebody so much you can barely breathe when you're with 'em?
          <br />
          You meet, and neither one of you even know what hit 'em
          <br />
          Got that warm fuzzy feelin', yeah, them chills, used to get 'em
          <br />
          Now you're gettin' fuckin' sick of lookin' at 'em?
          <br />
          You swore you'd never hit 'em, never do nothin' to hurt 'em
          <br />
          Now you're in each other's face spewin' venom in your words when you spit 'em
          <br />
          You push, pull each other's hair, scratch, claw, bit 'em
          <br />
          Throw 'em down, pin 'em, so lost in the moments when you're in 'em
          <br />
          It's the rage that took over, it controls you both
          <br />
          So they say you're best to go your separate ways, guess that they don't know ya
          <br />
          'Cause today, that was yesterday, yesterday is over
          <br />
          It's a different day, sound like broken records playin' over
          <br />
          But you promised her, next time you'll show restraint
          <br />
          You don't get another chance, life is no Nintendo game, but you lied again
          <br />
          Now you get to watch her leave out the window
          <br />
          Guess that's why they call it window pane
          <br />
          <br />
          [Chorus: Rihanna]
          <br />
          Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
          <br />
          Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts
          <br />
          Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
          <br />
          Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie
          <br />
          I love the way you lie
          <br />
          I love the way you lie
          <br />
          <br />
          [Verse 3: Eminem]
          <br />
          Now, I know we said things, did things that we didn't mean
          <br />
          Then we fall back into the same patterns, same routine
          <br />
          But your temper's just as bad as mine is, you're the same as me
          <br />
          When it comes to love you're just as blinded, baby, please
          <br />
          Come back, it wasn't you, baby, it was me
          <br />
          Maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems
          <br />
          Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano
          <br />
          All I know is I love you too much to walk away though
          <br />
          Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk
          <br />
          Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk?
          <br />
          Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball
          <br />
          Next time I'm pissed, I'll aim my fist at the drywall
          <br />
          Next time? There won't be no next time!
          <br />
          I apologize, even though I know it's lies
          <br />
          I'm tired of the games, I just want her back, I know I'm a liar
          <br />
          If she ever tries to fuckin' leave again, I'ma tie her
          <br />
          To the bed and set this house on fire, just gonna
          <br />
          <br />
          [Chorus: Rihanna]
          <br />
          Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
          <br />
          Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts
          <br />
          Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
          <br />
          Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie
          <br />
          I love the way you lie
          <br />
          I love the way you lie
