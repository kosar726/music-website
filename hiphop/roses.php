          [Intro: Future & SAINt JHN]
          <br />
          Remix
          <br />
          Off the corner with the money, I got a birds eye
          <br />
          Cook that shit up, Quay
          <br />
          SAINt JHN,?Pluto Hndrxx
          <br />
          Told Lee?he'd be a millionaire
          <br />
          <br />
          [Verse 1: SAINt JHN]
          <br />
          Roses
          <br />
          I walked in?the corner with the body screaming dolo
          <br />
          Never sold a bag but look like Pablo in a photo
          <br />
          This gon' make 'em feel the way like Tony killed Manolo
          <br />
          You already know though, you already know though
          <br />
          I walk in the corner with the money, on my finger
          <br />
          She might get it popping, I might wife her for the winter
          <br />
          I already know, already know, nigga roses
          <br />
          All I need is roses
          <br />
          <br />
          [Chorus: SAINt JHN & Future]
          <br />
          Turn up baby, turn up, when I turn it on (Turn up, turn up)
          <br />
          You know how I get too lit when I turn it on (Turn up, turn up)
          <br />
          Can't handle my behavior when I turn it on
          <br />
          Too fast, never ask, if the life don't last
          <br />
          Done been through it all (Woah)
          <br />
          Fuck with a nigga raw, this who you wanna be (Let's go)
          <br />
          And I know you won't tell nobody nothing (Tell nobody)
          <br />
          And I know you won't tell nobody no
          <br />
          [Verse 2: SAINt JHN & Future]
          <br />
          Roses
          <br />
          I might pull up flexing on these niggas like aerobics (Wow)
          <br />
          I might tell her girl you cute but balling, that shit gorgeous (Woah)
          <br />
          Standing on the table, Rosé, Rosé, fuck the waters (Wow)
          <br />
          You know who the God is
          <br />
          <br />
          [Chorus: SAINt JHN & Future]
          <br />
          Turn up baby, turn up, when I turn it on (Turn up, turn up)
          <br />
          You know how I get too lit when I turn it on (Turn up, turn up, turn it on)
          <br />
          Can't handle my behavior when I turn it on
          <br />
          Too fast, never ask, if the life don't last
          <br />
          Done been through it all
          <br />
          Fuck with a nigga raw, this who you wanna be
          <br />
          <br />
          [Verse 3: SAINt JHN & Future]
          <br />
          I might bring them Brooklyn niggas out, oh Lord, it's overs
          <br />
          I might bring them strippers out and tell 'em do it pole-less
          <br />
          You already know, already know, nigga roses
          <br />
          Kill 'em, make it, turn up baby, turn up, when I-
          <br />
          (You already know, you already know)
          <br />
          <br />
          [Verse 4: Future]
          <br />
          Shawty gon' turn up and get at these bands
          <br />
          Shawty ain't scared and she brought me a friend
          <br />
          Check up the temperature, I flip all this cash
          <br />
          Fuck up a check, did a flex on the bitch
          <br />
          After talkin' the shit, I'ma flex on his ho
          <br />
          Canary yellow, baguettes with the glow
          <br />
          Question his Audemars, VVS froze
          <br />
          Turn it up, green light, everything go
          <br />
          Need interpreters, I don't even talk to you hoes
          <br />
          I need a translator for these hoes
          <br />
          I got so many exotics standing abroad
          <br />
          Ice, baguettie-o's, yes (Ice), bad, bad bitches, so cold (You already know)
          <br />
          Beat up the pot, she came with a key (You already know)
          <br />
          Emilio Pucci keep all the secrets (You already know)
          <br />
          Solitary diamonds, solitary
          <br />
          Ready to go slide in the bank
          <br />
          Chopper say nah-nah, my bitches complain
          <br />
          Omert for the campaign ('Mert, 'Mert?)
          <br />
          <br />
          [Chorus: SAINt JHN & Future]
          <br />
          Turn up baby, turn up, when I turn it on (Keep a lotta drugs)
          <br />
          You know how I get too lit when I turn it on (Got a couple models)
          <br />
          Can't handle my behavior when I turn it on
          <br />
          Too fast, never ask, if the life don't last
          <br />
          Done been through it all
          <br />
          Fuck with a nigga raw, this who you wanna be
