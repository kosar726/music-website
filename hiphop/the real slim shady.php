          [Intro]
          <br />
          May I have your attention, please?
          <br />
          May I have your attention, please?
          <br />
          Will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
          <br />
          I repeat, will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
          <br />
          We're gonna have a problem here...
          <br />
          <br />
          [Verse 1]
          <br />
          Y'all act like you never seen a white person before
          <br />
          Jaws all on the floor like Pam like Tommy just burst in the door
          <br />
          And started whoopin' her ass worse than before
          <br />
          They first were divorced, suin' her over furniture (Agh!)
          <br />
          It's the return of the "Ah, wait, no way, you're kidding
          <br />
          He didn't just say what I think he did, did he?"
          <br />
          And Dr. Dre said… nothing, you idiots!
          <br />
          Dr. Dre's dead, he's locked in my basement (ha ha!)
          <br />
          Feminist women love Eminem
          <br />
          "Chicka, chicka, chicka, Slim Shady, I'm sick of him
          <br />
          Look at him, walkin' around, grabbin' his you-know-what
          <br />
          Flippin' the you-know-who," "Yeah, but he's so cute though."
          <br />
          Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
          <br />
          But no worse than what's goin' on in your parents' bedrooms
          <br />
          Sometimes I wanna get on TV and just let loose
          <br />
          But can't, but it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose
          <br />
          "My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips"
          <br />
          And if I'm lucky, you might just give it a little kiss
          <br />
          And that's the message that we deliver to little kids
          <br />
          And expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is
          <br />
          Of course, they're gonna know what intercourse is
          <br />
          By the time they hit fourth grade
          <br />
          They've got the Discovery Channel, don't they?
          <br />
          We ain't nothin' but mammals—well, some of us, cannibals
          <br />
          Who cut other people open like cantaloupes
          <br />
          But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
          <br />
          Then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope
          <br />
          But if you feel like I feel, I got the antidote
          <br />
          Women, wave your pantyhose, sing the chorus, and it goes—
          <br />
          <br />
          [Chorus]
          <br />
          I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
          <br />
          All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
          <br />
          So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
          <br />
          Please stand up, please stand up?
          <br />
          'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
          <br />
          All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
          <br />
          So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
          <br />
          Please stand up, please stand up?
          <br />
          <br />
          [Verse 2]
          <br />
          Will Smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell records (Nope)
          <br />
          Well, I do, so fuck him and fuck you too!
          <br />
          You think I give a damn about a Grammy?
          <br />
          Half of you critics can't even stomach me, let alone stand me
          <br />
          "But Slim, what if you win, wouldn't it be weird?"
          <br />
          Why, so you guys could just lie to get me here?
          <br />
          So you can sit me here next to Britney Spears?
          <br />
          Shit, Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs
          <br />
          So I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst
          <br />
          And hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first
          <br />
          Little bitch put me on blast on MTV
          <br />
          "Yeah, he's cute, but I think he's married to Kim, hee-hee."
          <br />
          I should download her audio on MP3
          <br />
          And show the whole world how you gave Eminem VD (Agh!)
          <br />
          I'm sick of you little girl and boy groups
          <br />
          All you do is annoy me, so I have been sent here to destroy you
          <br />
          And there's a million of us just like me
          <br />
          Who cuss like me, who just don't give a fuck like me
          <br />
          Who dress like me; walk, talk and act like me
          <br />
          And just might be the next best thing, but not quite me
          <br />
          <br />
          [Chorus]
          <br />
          'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
          <br />
          All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
          <br />
          So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
          <br />
          Please stand up, please stand up?
          <br />
          'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
          <br />
          All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
          <br />
          So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
          <br />
          Please stand up, please stand up?
          <br />
          <br />
          [Verse 3]
          <br />
          I'm like a head trip to listen to, ‘cause I'm only givin' you
          <br />
          Things you joke about with your friends inside your livin' room
          <br />
          The only difference is I got the balls to say it in front of y'all
          <br />
          And I don't gotta be false or sugarcoat it at all
          <br />
          I just get on the mic and spit it
          <br />
          And whether you like to admit it, I just shit it
          <br />
          Better than 90% of you rappers out can
          <br />
          Then you wonder: "How can
          <br />
          Kids eat up these albums like Valiums?"
          <br />
          It's funny, ‘cause at the rate, I'm going, when I'm 30
          <br />
          I'll be the only person in the nursing home flirting
          <br />
          Pinching nurse's asses when I'm jacking off with Jergens
          <br />
          And I'm jerking, but this whole bag of Viagra isn't working
          <br />
          And every single person is a Slim Shady lurking
          <br />
          He could be working at Burger King, spittin' on your onion rings
          <br />
          Or in the parking lot, circling, screaming, "I don't give a fuck!"
          <br />
          With his windows down and his system up
          <br />
          So will the real Shady please stand up
          <br />
          And put one of those fingers on each hand up?
          <br />
          And be proud to be outta your mind and outta control
          <br />
          And one more time, loud as you can, how does it go?
          <br />
          <br />
          [Chorus]
          <br />
          I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
          <br />
          All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
          <br />
          So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
          <br />
          Please stand up, please stand up?
          <br />
          'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
          <br />
          All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
          <br />
          So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
          <br />
          Please stand up, please stand up?
          <br />
          'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
          <br />
          All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
          <br />
          So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
          <br />
          Please stand up, please stand up?
          <br />
          'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
          <br />
          All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
          <br />
          So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
          <br />
          Please stand up, please stand up?
          <br />
          <br />
          [Outro]
          <br />
          Ha ha, I guess there’s a Slim Shady in all of us
          <br />
          Fuck it, let’s all stand up!
          <br />
