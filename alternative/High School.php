          [Chorus]
          <br />
          Can we just be honest?
          <br />
          These are the requirements
          <br />
          If you think you can be my one and only true love
          <br />
          You must promise to love me
          <br />
          And damn it, if you fuck me over
          <br />
          I will rip your fucking face apart
          <br />
          <br />
          [Verse 1]
          <br />
          Step one
          <br />
          You must accept that I'm a little out my mind
          <br />
          Step two
          <br />
          This is a waste if you can't walk me down the finish line
          <br />
          Step three
          <br />
          Give me passion, don't make fun of my fashion
          <br />
          Step four
          <br />
          Give me more, give me more, more
          <br />
          <br />
          [Pre-Chorus]
          <br />
          If you can't handle a heart like mine
          <br />
          Don't waste your time with me
          <br />
          If you're not down to bleed, no, oh
          <br />
          If you can't handle the choking, the biting
          <br />
          The loving, the smothering
          <br />
          'Til you can't handle it no more, no more
          <br />
          Go home
          <br />
          <br />
          [Chorus]

          [Post-Chorus]
          <br />
          High school sweethearts, line up
          <br />
          Not trying to waste my time
          <br />

          [Verse 2]
          <br />
          Step five
          <br />
          You can't be scared to show me off and hold my hand
          <br />
          Step six
          <br />
          If you can't put in work, I don't know what you think this fucking is
          <br />
          Step seven, this one goes to eleven
          <br />
          If you cheat, you will die, die
          <br />
          <br />
          [Pre-Chorus]
          <br />
          If you can't handle a heart like mine

          Don't waste your time with me

          [Bridge]
          <br />
          Could you hold me through the night?
          <br />
          Put your lips all over my
          <br />
          Salty face when I start cryin'
          <br />
          Could you be my first time?
          <br />
          Eat me up like apple pie
          <br />
          Make me not wanna die
          <br />
          Love me rough and let me fly
          <br />
          Get me up, yeah, get me high
          <br />
          Tie me down, don't leave my side
