          [Intro]
          <br />
          I don't care enough to miss you
          <br />
          After all the shit we've been through
          <br />
          My heart's comatose,?comatose
          <br />
          <br />
          [Verse 1]
          <br />
          You?were my best?friend, now you're dead to me
          <br />
          Said?you'd become my worst memory
          <br />
          You played the victim in reality
          <br />
          You?never?were
          <br />
          [Pre-Chorus]
          <br />
          Straight?coats and empty?cabinets
          <br />
          Ashes from all?the mess you left
          <br />
          New lease without you
          <br />
          I confess that I'm happy you're gone
          <br />
          <br />
          [Chorus]
          <br />
          I don't care enough to miss you
          <br />
          After all the shit we've been through
          <br />
          My heart's comatose, comatose
          <br />
          I don't care enough to miss you
          <br />
          After all the shit we've been through
          <br />
          My heart's comatose, comatose
          <br />
          <br />
          [Verse 2]
          <br />
          So used to pain that it's my remedy
          <br />
          Easy to hate, I gave you everything
          <br />
          Funny that you're the one that ran away
          <br />
          You left me first
          <br />
          <br />
          [Pre-Chorus]
          <br />
          Straight coats and empty cabinets
          <br />
          Ashes from all the mess you left
          <br />
          New lease without you
          <br />
          I confess that I'm happy you're gone
          <br />
          <br />
          [Chorus]
          <br />
          I don't care enough to miss you
          <br />
          After all the shit we've been through
          <br />
          My heart's comatose, comatose
          <br />
          I don't care enough to miss you
          <br />
          After all the shit we've been through
          <br />
          My heart's comatose, comatose
          <br />
          <br />
          [Bridge]
          <br />
          You wasted all my fucking time
          <br />
          Were never really in my life
          <br />
          You were further than I could imagine
          <br />
          I loved you, but fuck you
          <br />
          <br />
          [Chorus]
          <br />
          I don't care enough to miss you
          <br />
          After all the shit we've been through
          <br />
          My heart's comatose, comatose
          <br />
          <br />
          [Outro]
          <br />
          I don't care enough, care enough
          <br />
          My heart's comatose
          <br />
          My heart's comatose, comatose
          <br />
